# Has my package arrived?

This repo contains the code for trained and deployed computer vision model for retail application intended to identify whether or not an image includes an object of interest, i.e., a package in the front porch. Data was captured with a PiCamera and transitted to an S3 bucket for image ingestion, model training and deployment using Databicks ML runtime. This project is based on the article [Enabling Computer Vision Applications With the Data Lakehouse](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2021/12/17/enabling-computer-vision-applications-with-the-data-lakehouse.html)
